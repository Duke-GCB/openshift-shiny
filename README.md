# openshift-shiny
Allows a user to simply deploy a [R](https://www.r-project.org/) [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app to an OpenShift cluster.

This is accomplished by providing
1. Base Docker images that are compatible with OpenShift
2. OpenShift Templates for deploying a shiny app

The Docker image tags match those of parent docker images from [rocker/shiny* images](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2).

## Prerequisites
- Shiny R code stored in a git repository

## Steps to Deploy your shiny app

### Create a Dockerfile in your git repo
Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your git repo.
This file will specify:
- The base docker image to use (such as `dukegcb/openshift-shiny-verse:4.0.2`)
- Any additional requirements that need to be installed
- Location of your R code within your repo

As an example if your R shiny app is under a directory named `src` within your git repo and you need no additional requirements create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:
```
FROM dukegcb/openshift-shiny-verse:4.0.2
ADD ./src /srv/code
```

If you need to additionally install the [here shiny package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

For example if yourf R shiny code is under directory named `src` and you want to install the [here shiny package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following contents:
```
FROM dukegcb/openshift-shiny-verse:4.0.2
RUN install2.r here
ADD ./src /srv/code
```
The `install2.r` script is a simple utility to install R packages that is provided by the `rocker` images.

### Deploy your shiny app using the OpenShift console
In this step we will run an OpenShift template to deploy your shiny app.
The following steps should be performed from the OpenShift console:
- Create a new OpenShift project and select it
- In the top right corner Click "Add To Project" then "Import YAML/JSON" - this will open up a "Import YAML/JSON" dialog
- Copy the contents of [openshift/shiny-server.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duke-GCB/openshift-shiny/improve-readme/openshift/shiny-server.yaml) and paste it into the "Import YAML/JSON" dialog
- Click "Create
- Leave "Process the template" checked and click "Continue"
- Update the parameters that are appropriate for your app. Minimally set APP_GIT_URI to your git repo location and REPO_DOCKERFILE_PATH to your dockerfile path location.
- Click "Create"
- Click "Applications" then "Deployments". Wait for your app to be deployed.
- Click "Applications" then "Services". Select your new service and click "create route".
- Navigate to your new route to view your app.

### Deploy your shiny app using the command line
Create a project for your app.
```
oc new-project <your_project_name>
```

Deploy you app.
```
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duke-GCB/openshift-shiny/master/openshift/shiny-server.yaml \
   -p APP_GIT_URI=<YOUR_GIT_REPO> \
   -p APP_GIT_BRANCH=<YOUR_GIT_BRANCH> \
   -p REPO_DOCKERFILE_PATH=<PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE_IN_YOUR_REPO> \
   | oc create -f -
```
Parameters for shiny-server.yaml
```
PARAMETER NAME         DESCRIPTION              DEFAULT VALUE
================================================================================================
APP_NAME               Name used for the app    shiny-app
APP_LABEL              Label used for the app   shiny
APP_GIT_URI            Deployment git uri       https://github.com/Duke-GCB/openshift-shiny.git
APP_GIT_BRANCH         Deployment git branch    master
REPO_DOCKERFILE_PATH   Deployment git branch    examples/hello-shiny/Dockerfile
```

If you just wish to try out the template use the default values to deploy the example hello-shiny app like so:
```
oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duke-GCB/openshift-shiny/master/openshift/shiny-server.yaml \
    | oc create -f -
```
